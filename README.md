# Moon-Rover-Navigation
Moon Rover Navigation is a Python project that simulates the movement of robotic rovers on a rectangular plateau located on the Moon's surface. Inspired by the exploration missions conducted by space agencies, such as ISRO, the project allows users to input the size of the plateau, positions, and movement instructions for multiple rovers. The rovers are controlled using a simple set of commands ('L' for left, 'R' for right, and 'M' for move forward), and their final positions and orientations are displayed. The program handles input in both uppercase and lowercase letters to enhance user convenience. This project serves as an educational resource for grasping fundamental concepts of navigation and programming logic. It also offers a glimpse into the challenges encountered in space exploration within a simplified context.
 New features include enhanced input validation, instruction verification, improved user experience, and comprehensive test coverage.
